### Components
#### Molotov cocktail
Let Molotov coctail do fire damage instead of explosive (and optionally, enable "burning death" animation)
#### Level 5 after temple of trials
Nets the Chosen 10000 xp for completing the temple of trials
#### Grenades ignore armor class
Removes AC penalty from grenades, since they are actually thrown to target's feet, not "through" armor. This also affects explosive rockets from rocket launcher and grenade launchers from EcCo mod.
#### Max carry weight
AKA inventory pain killer, part 1. Let the Chosen carry up to 999 (max allowed by the engine) pounds. It's nearly unlimited in game terms. Naturally, that obsoletes "Strong back" and makes "Small frame" pure cheat.
#### Unlimited trunk
Inventory pain killer, part 2. Never worry about trunk filling up.
#### Silence fake reload animation
Silence really annoying SMG/rifle "reload" sound which the dude does when he's idle (which is every few seconds). The animation itself still plays.
#### Armor doesn't slow down chosen
In the original game, running becomes slower as armor gets heavier. This component disables that behaviour, so that run speed is constant and fast.
#### Inventory filter
Inventory pain killer, part 3. This is the ultimate inventory mod which allows you to *filter* your stuff. The actual author is [Mr.Сталин](http://www.nuclear-city.com/index.php/topic/512-плагин-filter-inventory-для-fallout2-и-модов/page-1)
Tips:
- Press control to activate the second set of buttons
- Use middle mouse click on weapon/ammo buttons to see both item types
- You can't use bags (which aren't in original Fallout 2 anyway, but possibly may be added by 3rd party mods)

### Special notes
- **It will ONLY work if you have killap's patch** or restoration pack installed. You can get those at http://www.killap.net.
- It should be **compatible with any other mod** provided that "fo2tweaks" is installed last. It patches files instead of overwriting them.
- Starting a **new game is required for only components marked by star "*"**.
