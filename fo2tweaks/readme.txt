### Components
#### Molotov cocktail: fire damage
Let Molotov coctail do fire damage instead of explosive (and optionally, enable "burning death" animation)`
#### Grenades ignore armor class
Removes AC penalty from grenades, since they are actually thrown to target's feet, not "through" armor. This also affects explosive rockets from rocket launcher and grenade launchers from EcCo mod.
#### Level 5 after temple of trials
Nets the Chosen 10000 xp for completing the temple of trials
#### Max carry weight
AKA inventory pain killer, part 1. Let the Chosen carry up to 999 (max allowed by the engine) pounds. It's nearly unlimited in game terms. Naturally, that obsoletes "Strong back" and makes "Small frame" pure cheat.
#### Unlimited trunk
Inventory pain killer, part 2. Never worry about trunk filling up.
#### Silence fake reload animation
Silence really annoying SMG/rifle "reload" sound which the dude does when he's idle (which is every few seconds). The animation itself still plays.
#### Armor doesn't reduce run speed
In the original game, running becomes slower as armor gets heavier. This component disables that behaviour, so that run speed is constant and fast.
#### Inventory filter
Inventory pain killer, part 3. This is the ultimate inventory mod which allows you to *filter* your stuff. The actual author is [Mr.Сталин](http://www.nuclear-city.com/index.php/topic/512-плагин-filter-inventory-для-fallout2-и-модов/page-1). This component requires Sfall version at least 3.5. If Sfall is not found or is too old, a newer version will be installed automatically.

Tips:
- Press control to activate the second set of buttons
- Use middle mouse click on weapon/ammo buttons to see both item types
- You can't use bags (which aren't in original Fallout 2 anyway, but possibly may be added by 3rd party mods)

#### Unlimited party
This component removes charisma checks upon joining the party. It does not remove other checks (karma, etc). For example, Goris may still decline to join if you're a "bad guy".

The following companions are affected:
- Brain bot
- Cassidy
- Cat Jules
- Davin
- Dex
- Dogmeat
- Goris
- Kitsune
- K-9
- Lenny

### Special notes / compatibility
- **It will ONLY work if you have killap's patch** or restoration pack installed. You can get those at http://www.killap.net.
- It should be **compatible with any other mod** provided that "fo2tweaks" is installed last. It patches files instead of overwriting them.
